        <h3>Written by Movie House Memories</h3>
        <p>
          Shrek (Mike Myers) is a large, temperamental, green ogre who lives in
          the swamp. He is extremely anti-social and prefers to keep to himself
          in his swamp. He fears none of the nearby townspeople who are
          generally frightened of Shrek based on his mere appearance. Shrek’s
          life is turned upside down when the dwarfish Lord Farquaad (John
          Lithgow) of Duloc unknowingly exiles a large number of fairy-tale
          creatures into Shrek’s swamp. The creatures hide in the swamp to avoid
          detention by Farquaad’s soldiers. One of the creatures is an annoying,
          talking Donkey named Donkey (Eddie Murphy). Shrek wants his privacy,
          so he sets out to get Farquaad to clear his swamp of the creatures.
          Donkey decides to tag along and guides Shrek to Duloc. Meanwhile,
          Farquaad is presented with Snow White’s Magic Mirror (Chris Miller),
          who informs the diminutive poser that to become a true king, he must
          marry a princess. Farquaad chooses Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), a
          princess who is imprisoned in a castle tower guarded by a dragon.
          However, Farquaad is a coward and unwilling to perform the task
          himself. Farquaad decides to put on a tournament to find the strongest
          and most worthy who will have the honor of rescuing Fiona for
          Farquaad. Shrek and Donkey arrive during the tournament, and Shrek
          easily defeats the other competitors. Farquaad proclaims them
          champions and orders Shrek and Donkey to rescue Fiona. Shrek agrees if
          Farquaad will remove all the fairytale creatures if he succeeds on the
          quest. Farquaad accepts Shrek’s terms. Shrek and Donkey make the long
          quest to the abandoned castle where Fiona is held. Once there, they
          are attacked by the Dragon, who corners Donkey. Donkey quickly sweet
          talks the Dragon, who turns out to be a female and falls in love with
          him. At the same time, Shrek finds Fiona. The princess is put out by
          the lack of romanticism that Shrek displays towards her. She is even
          more flabbergasted to learn that Shrek has not slain the dragon. The
          pair flee the castle after rescuing Donkey. Once safely away, Shrek
          removes his helmet and reveals himself as an ogre to Fiona. The
          princess is disappointed in her savior and demands to be returned to
          the castle and orders Shrek to tell Farquaad to come rescue her
          himself. Shrek rejects both of her requests and forcibly carries her
          against her will. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.
          Blue flower, red thorns. Man, this would be so much easier if I wasn’t
          COLOR-BLIND! Donkey That night, the trio set up camp. Fiona decides to
          sleep alone in a cave. Over the campfire, Shrek confides in Donkey his
          frustration with being constantly feared and rejected by all others
          over his monstrous appearance. Unbeknownst to Shrek, Fiona overhears
          his conversation and decides to be kind to Shrek. The next day, the
          trio encounter “Monsieur” Robin Hood (Vincent Cassel) and his band of
          Merry Men. The bandits attack, and Fiona handles them easily with
          martial arts straight out of a Matrix film. Shrek is surprised and
          impressed with Fiona. The two secretly begin to fall in love with each
          other. The trio stops for the night when they are day’s journey from
          Duloc. Fiona hurriedly takes shelter in a windmill for the evening.
          Donkey enters the windmill alone and discovers that Fiona has
          transformed into an ogress. Fiona sadly explains that since she was a
          small child, she has been cursed to transform into an ogress every
          night after sunset and reverts to her human self at sunrise. Fiona
          explains that only “true love’s kiss” can break the spell and change
          her into “love’s true form.” At the same time, Shrek works up the
          courage to confess his feelings to Fiona but overhears the
          conversation between Fiona and Donkey. He misunderstands Fiona’s
          comments about herself as an ugly beast and believes she is referring
          to him. Shrek angrily leaves and returns the next morning with Lord
          Farquaad. Fiona is confused and hurt as to Shrek’s sudden hostility
          towards her. She accepts Farquaad’s marriage proposal and requests
          they be married before nightfall. Shrek ditches Donkey and returns to
          his swamp alone. Donkey refuses to give up on Shrek and follows the
          ogre to his swamp. Donkey confronts the angry Shrek, and the two
          friends fight. Donkey explains that the ugly beast comment by Fiona
          was referring to someone else, and Donkey and Shrek reconcile. Donkey
          urges Shrek to go to Fiona and express his true feelings for her
          before she marries Farquaad. The Dragon arrives, and Shrek and Donkey
          use her to travel quickly to Duloc. Shrek arrives at the wedding and
          interrupts the ceremony just before the end. Shrek tells Fiona that
          Farquaad is only marrying her so that he can become king. At that
          moment, the sun sets, and Fiona transforms into an ogress in front of
          everyone, including Shrek. Shrek finally understands what he heard at
          the windmill. Farquaad is outraged at nearly marrying an ogress and
          orders Shrek to be executed and Fiona arrested. At that moment, the
          Dragon arrives, guided by Donkey, and devours Farquaad. The people of
          Duloc are delighted by the short man’s demise. Shrek and Fiona profess
          their love for one another and share a kiss. Magic happens and Fiona
          assumes love’s true form, which is the form of an ogress. Fiona
          believes that she is no longer beautiful until Shrek consoles her and
          tells her that she has always been. They marry in the swamp with all
          the fairy-tale creatures in attendance before leaving for their
          honeymoon.
