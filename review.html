              <h4>Shrek: Breathtaking animation and very laughable</h4>
              <p>
                There was a time when swearing was a big no-no in films from the
                squeaky clean DreamWorks stable. But then we had "cunt" in
                American Beauty, and now, in Shrek, their glucose-enriched
                computer animation comedy for all the family, we have "fuckwad".
                That is: the evil Lord Farquaad, who banishes all fairy tale
                characters from his kingdom, and the purpose of whose odd name
                can only be to contain that single entendre. It's hardly a
                pointer to the rest of the movie's tone; in fact it's a measure
                of Shrek's uproarious wholesomeness that it almost gets away
                with the sheer effrontery of that gag without anyone noticing.
                At any rate, Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson's film contains
                some breathtaking state-of-the-art computer animation, with
                every blade of grass in the meadow and every donkey hair
                lovingly distinguished. This film is more lively, more sparky,
                and indeed more animated than Disney's ponderous Dinosaur - and
                the better craftsmanship here consequently does more comic and
                dramatic work. Not a minute goes by without a happy invention or
                a laugh line of some kind. My favourite was Farquaad torturing
                information out of a gingerbread man that he has chained to a
                table after breaking off its legs. "You can't catch me, I'm the
                gingerbread man," he sneers cruelly. And there is a terrific
                romantic sequence where Shrek and Fiona stroll through a meadow,
                having inflated a toad and a snake as balloons, to the sound of
                My Beloved Monster by the Eels.

              <h4>Shrek (2001)</h4>
              <p>
                Someone recently said that with the money and personnel that go
                into creating a movie, it's scandalous that they should come out
                with anything less than a classic. That may be a naïve
                statement, but it's potent in the case of "Shrek", which has
                been in gestation for five years, features some of the funniest
                actors on the planet, and cost in the region of $100 million.
                Luckily, it is fantastic - and this is why. Firstly, the script
                is superb. Thankfully, really, because the plot is essentially
                pretty conventional. Set in a CGI world populated by kings,
                mythical creatures, and - er - fairytale characters, it sees an
                oddball Scottish ogre (voiced by Myers) hooking up with a flip,
                donkey sidekick (Murphy) to rescue a princess (Diaz) and defeat
                an evil overlord, while finding himself in the process. However,
                this fable structure is allied to both a witty cynicism and
                sense of fun, which pervades the entire movie in equal measure.
                As a result, the film appeals to both adults and children: kids
                will love the colourful, cutting-edge computer animation, while
                everyone else should get a kick out of the tirade of visual and
                vocal gags, which often step into the realm of both dark and
                crude humour - many far too naughty to retell on a family
                website. Meanwhile, the voice artists inject both warmth and
                comedy into their characters, Murphy stealing the show as the
                donkey with verbal diarrhoea. Oh - and if you need any more
                recommendations, the soundtrack contains tracks by Leonard Cohen
                and The Proclaimers. Brilliant.

              <h4>'Shrek': A Funny, Fractured Fairy Tale</h4>
              <p>
                In William Steig's children's book of the same name, Shrek was a
                great character. And thanks to the cutting-edge wonders of
                PDI/DreamWorks' computer animation – the ability now to render
                the fluidity of the human face and evoke the realness of life –
                he becomes a great character on-screen. While kids can chortle
                at Farquaad torturing the Gingerbread Man in a protracted,
                cookie-crumbling scene (The horror, the horror!), grownups can
                smirk at jokes about Disneyland's character-named parking lots
                or laugh at the scene when Farquaad consults with the Magic
                Mirror for wifely candidates. Snow White, says the Mirror, is
                definitely possible. "Although she lives with seven men," he
                tells Farquaad, "she's not easy." The bread and butter of the
                movie, though, is the back-and-forth among the three main
                characters as they journey to Farquaad. Myers is inventively
                funny, as are Murphy, who's doing slightly badder variations on
                his "Mulan" character, Mushu, and Diaz, who makes a funny,
                earthy princess. There's a rather lovely romantic element at
                work, too, which hinges on the princess's closely held secret –
                and a positive message about inner beauty in the bargain. So, we
                have a movie that appeals to the eye, mind, heart and funny
                bone; that's a pretty good quadruple for any movie. It's
                certainly a bright first step for the summer.

              <h4>
                'Shrek' it out: an unlikely lovable ogre cavorts in an instant
                fairy-tale classic
              </h4>
              <p>
                A FAT green ogre with a grouchy disposition and worse manners,
                “Shrek” is the sort of unlikely hero that nobody could love –
                except just about everyone who sees this hip and hilarious
                animated delight. The incredibly detailed computer animation is
                a breakthrough that makes such past efforts as “Antz” and even
                “Toy Story” look almost primitive. But it’s old-fashioned, solid
                storytelling that will have audiences on their feet for this
                instant classic, whose characters are far more involving than
                those of most live-action movies these days. The superb visuals
                – including human characters who are far more realistic than any
                seen so far – are matched by terrific vocal work. “Shrek” is an
                unqualified triumph for co-directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky
                Jenson, and screenwriters Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Joe
                Stillman and Roger S.H. Shulman. When Donkey delivers a
                rollicking rendition of “I’m a Believer” (one of many old and
                new rock songs effectively deployed on the sound track) in the
                last scene, you can’t help but agree – “Shrek” has cast a spell
                that’s magical.
